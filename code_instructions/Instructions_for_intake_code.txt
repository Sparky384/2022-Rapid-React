Instructions for making the intake work
===================================================================
Create an Intake class (ctrl + shift + p, create new file, make a java class)
Needs 1 variable for motor (CANSparkMax datatype)
Needs a constructor
	should set the motor variable to something: this link tells you what parameters the spark needs https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/java/com/revrobotics/cansparkmax#%3Cinit%3E(int,com.revrobotics.CANSparkMaxLowLevel.MotorType)
		you will need Jumper's help to get the CAN ID
needs 3 methods
	public void intakeIn
		no parameters needed
		drive motor in one direction use the previous link to figure out which method is correct
	public void intakeOut
		no parameters needed
		drive motor in other direction as from above, use the previous link to figure out which method is correct
	public void stopIntake
		no paremeters needed
		stop motors driving, always use the link

===================================================================
In Robot class
Need to add Intake variable (top of class)
Need to set intake variable in constructor (see DriveTrain for example)
Add controls in teleopPeriodic method
	Make A button intakeIn
	Make B button intakeOut
	LITTLE TRICK
		You need to stop the motor if NEITHER of the buttons are pressed
		This requires an if-else statement (1 if for A button, 1 else if for B button, 1 else for stopping the motors)
			Basic if-else statement:
				if (some condition)
				{
					code that happens when condition is met
				}
				else if (some condition)
				{
					code that happens when other condition is met
				}
				else
				{
					code that happens when neither condition is met
				}
		To get the buttons use pilot.getAButton()
